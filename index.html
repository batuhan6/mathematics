            <h2>1. Linear Algebra</h2>
        </a>
        <p> 
            Used for representing and manipulating data in the form of matrices. Linear algebra is fundamental for 
            understanding operations in neural networks, which involve matrix multiplications, transformations, and eigenvalue calculations.

    <section id="calculus">
        <h2>2. Calculus</h2>
        <p>
            Essential for understanding the optimization process in machine learning, such as gradient descent. Calculus is used to find the minima 
            or maxima of functions, which is crucial in training machine learning models.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="statistics">
        <h2>3. Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Forms the basis for inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation. It helps in making decisions about the generalization 
            ability of a model and assessing the significance of observed patterns.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="probability-theory">
        <h2>4. Probability Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Provides the mathematical foundation for dealing with uncertainty and making predictions. Probability theory is used in various machine learning algorithms, including Bayesian models, to model and update beliefs about the likelihood of events.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="optimization">
        <h2>5. Optimization</h2>
        <p>
             Central to training machine learning models by finding the optimal set of parameters. Techniques like gradient descent and its variants are used to minimize the error or loss function during the learning process.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="information-theory">
        <h2>7. Information Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Useful in quantifying and measuring uncertainty in data. It is employed in designing efficient encoding schemes, feature selection, and model compression in machine learning.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="differential-equations">
        <h2>8. Differential Equations</h2>
        <p>
            Used in modeling dynamic systems and processes. In machine learning, differential equations are applied in areas such as time series analysis, physics-based simulations, and understanding the behavior of complex systems.
